	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. Understanding time complexity helps in writing efficient programs that perform well even with large datasets.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute. It is typically expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), which indicates how memory usage grows with input size.</p>
